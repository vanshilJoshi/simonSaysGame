        <p>A simple free online version of the memory game we know from childhood. Observe the buttons as they flash in asequence then repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons yourself.
            Each time you answer correctly the sequence begins again but with another button added. This game is an excellent way to excise your short term memory. After practicing for a while you might
            be surprised how high you can score.
